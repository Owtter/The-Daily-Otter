                    <p>
                        Granted, I didn't actually go to the zoo, neither did I see the otters myself.
                        One of my friends was nice enough to share the pictures they took at the zoo, though.
                        You can check them out in the gallery.

                    <p>
                        A Singapore resident was hospitalized after a bizarre animal attack last month in 
                        which he was accosted by a gang of otters, who reportedly bit him 26 times.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Spencer, who is in his 60s, was reportedly approaching 
                        the visitors center when he spotted around 20 otters crossing a dimly-lit path in 
                        front of him. He claimed it was the first time he had seen the mustelids in the area 
                        despite taking his morning walks there for five months. The animal encounter went 
                        south after a jogger ran through the pack, causing the fish-eaters to go 
                        “crazy like dogs” and try to bite the passerby, the shocked senior told Singapore's 
                        Today online newspaper.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now I know why it's suggested stay at least 5 kayak lengths away form any wild otter
                        you encounter.

                    <p>
                        A group of synthetic substances known as "forever chemicals" because of their environmental 
                        persistence have been found in otters across England and Wales. This suggests 
                        "widespread pollution" of British freshwaters today. This is likely due to wastewater
                        treatment works or use of sewage sludge in farming.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another great example of humans having a negative impact on the environment. Perhaps it's
                        time to spread some awareness.
